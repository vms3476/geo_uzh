function [las] = refine_power_lines(las, res, numPeaks, fillGap, minLength)

% this method uses removes small regions classified as power lines 
% which do not fall on large linear features across the tile. 
% the power line points are isolated and used to generate a raster.
% The hough, houghpeaks, and houghlines methods are used to determine
% significant lines in this raster. the lines are exteneded across the
% image extent. Image dilation and closing are used to create a solid
% region/boundary to encompass them. LAS points classified as power line
% which fall outside these linear regions are reclassified as vegetation.
%
% inputs: 
%
%   las - input LAS point cloud tile to be processed. Should be read using
%         LASread for the proper structure of fields (.record, .header)
%
%   res - [integer] resolution of the raster used as unput to hough
%
%   numPeaks - [integer] the number of peaks to identify in Hough 
%              transform. input parameter to houghpeaks
%
%   fillGap - [integer] distance between two line segments asspciated with 
%             the same Hough transform bin. input parameter to houghlines 
%
%   minLength - Minimum line length, specified as a positive real scalar. 
%               houghlines discards lines that are shorter than this value.
%               input parameter to houghlines 
%
%   
% output:
%
%   las - point cloud with selected points reclassified as 3 (vegetation) 
%         instead of power line (14)
